\section{Device}

\subsection{Design}
\begin{outline}
\1 Figures: Device drawing with photo of real hand
\1 Two pantagraph mechanisms provide 2DOF kinesthetic forces to fingertips
\1 Reaction forces on palm at handle
\1 Grip force:
	\2 Pololu micro metal gear motor 50:1 ratio 
	\2 motor provides resistance from objects pinched in the fingers

\1 Pantographs: 
	\2 3D printed links with pin joints
	\2 Center fingerpad spins freely 
	\2 Delrin (?) on fingerpad to maintain good contact with fingerpad
	\2 Nylon washer on back of pantograph to allow it to move smoothly over the back support
	\2 Faulhaber micro motors with encoders
	\2 Forward and inverse kinematics as described in \cite{Campion2005}
\1 Adjustable handle to accomodate different size hands, foam wrapped
