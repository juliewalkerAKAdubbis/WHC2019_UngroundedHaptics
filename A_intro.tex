\section{INTRODUCTION}

\begin{outline}
    \1 What is an ungrounded haptic device? 
    \1 What are the extra challenges?
    \2 No net forces and torques.
    \2 Can be unclear what the user's response will be
    \2 Can vary by user, user's arm/hand muscle activation, stiffness or size of users' hands, how they hold the device
    
    \1 What have other researchers done, and why didn't it work? 
    \2 \cite{Walker2017} used gaussian processes to model users responses to torque cues to guide them toward target orientations, challenges fitting the users' data well
    \2 GP was too slow to do online adaptation
    \2 device had too much variability because of asymmetric torque pulses
    
    \1 What did we do? And what was the outcome? 
    \2 applied model based optimization to a device with more clear inputs
