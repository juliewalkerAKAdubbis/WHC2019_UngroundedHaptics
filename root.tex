\begin{abstract}

Guidance provided through the sense of touch could speed learning and performance for applications like surgical training and delicate medical procedures. Hand-held kinesthetic haptic devices have benefits over traditional grounded haptic devices including freedom of motion and larger workspaces. This paper presents a haptic gripper with grip-force feedback and two degree-of-freedom tangential skin deformation on the thumb and index finger. It can provide object interaction forces to the fingertips as well as guidance cues in four degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the device is able to provide clear directional haptic guidance in a user experiment. We also demonstrate the device applied in a surgical training simulation. Handheld haptic devices like this one could enable haptic information to be included more easily in medical tasks and training, improving patient outcomes.

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity �Magnetization�, or �Magnetization, M�, not just �M�. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write �Magnetization (A/m)� or �Magnetization {A[m(1)]}�, not just �A/m�. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write �Temperature (K)�, not �Temperature/K.�


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
