\begin{abstract}

We made a haptic device. We tried it on people and modeled how they moved. We used MPC to build a controller based on the user model to guide people through trajectories. We found that it improved performance.

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity �Magnetization�, or �Magnetization, M�, not just �M�. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write �Magnetization (A/m)� or �Magnetization {A[m(1)]}�, not just �A/m�. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write �Temperature (K)�, not �Temperature/K.�


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{Appendix}

Appendixes should appear before the acknowledgment.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word �acknowledgment� in America is without an �e� after the �g�. Avoid the stilted expression, �One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .�  Instead, try �R. B. G. thanks�. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
